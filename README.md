# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I selected to work with Option 1 on  Canadian Open Data portal.It has different datasets specially worked with the below datasets.

Weekly earnings from 1.1.2001 to 15.4.2015 (weekly_earnings - CSV)
Housing constructions from 1955 to 2019 (real_estate_numbers - CSV)
House prices from 1.1.2005 to 1.9.2020 (real_estate_prices - EXCEL)
Housing_price_index from November 1979 to September 2020
Office_realestate_index from November 1979 to September 2020
Consumer index from November 1979 to September 2020

## Process
I connected the dataset to Tableau, studied and tried to understand the entire dataset. Examined the datatypes. Most of the relevant datatypes were numerical columns.

In the dataset, there are not too many missing values or duplicated records, so I did not got through cleaning process.
Date is the Primary key.But it has differnt worksheets , So I identified the relationship and based on the asked question 
I choose the worksheet to answer them accordingly.

The dataset contains a lot of categorical data types, date/datetime data type and numerical data types.  The types of visualizations included in the project are:
Bar charts
Histograms
Stacked bar chart
Forecasting
Maps
Lines
Heat map.

## Results

The results of the data visualization were presented using a story. The story begins from the correlations of prices in canada. to oth 
It showcase the various interesting features of the current trend and also distingush the data with the previous trend for the better comphrehension.

## Challenges 
There are so many workseets, Initially faced the difficulty on working on it , and also struggled with the weekly earnings JSON file.
Most of the questions were difficult to answer because I considered them in different ways and I feel confused on choosing the right way to answer.

## Future Goals
I would focus more on understanding the housing terms to gain better insights on the data and also would explore lot more with my own questions coming up.
